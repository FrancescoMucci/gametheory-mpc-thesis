# Game Theory and Multi-Party Computation bachelor's thesis

This repository contains my thesis work for the [Bachelor's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informatica.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/).

The aim of this thesis is provide a simple introduction to the Game Theory field, illustrate the secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) problem and show how participants in a MPC protocol can be modeled in a rational way throug the use of Game Theory.

The research work and thesis writing was done during the curricular internship at [Department of Statistics, Computer Science, Applications "Giuseppe Parenti" (University of Florence)](https://www.disia.unifi.it).
